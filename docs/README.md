# Bugbounty journal
This is my attempt to keep a journal of my experience with bug bounty. I want to approach this entire experience coming from a sysadmin and developer background with a lot of vulnerability research on the sides.

I am going to attempt to document my experience, thoughts before and after in the hopes that this may help others.

The reasons I am doing this are:
* Get a better understanding of the bugbounty process and get first hand experience with it
* Get better ideas for making targets for our echoCTF platform
* Learn a few of the tools i never wanted to learn, on the go and on the need, ie force my self to understand what gap each of the tool is trying to fill
* Create a Gitlab and Github pipeline that would allow bugbounty hunters and pen-testers to automate some tasks
* (maybe) Get lucky and score a payout

My trip to the bugbounty world starts at midnight of 25/11/2022. Unfortunately i cannot work on it during the day, so my attempts will have to be more directed and with purpose if i plan on doing anything significant.

* [day 1 - nothing ever goes as planned and that is a good thing](day1.md)
* [day 2 - this new plan will work for sure](day2.md)
