## Plan for the day
Its Friday again, (02/12/2022) and i'm preparing my plan for the day. I have spend parts of the week in studying a bit of GraphQL and deciding on some tooling that i will use.

I have prepared some pipelines that i want to test tonight and see if i can get better results and how this will work out.

The thing that worries me is that an almost weeklong break might be too much, as it will have a lot of catching up to do. I will cleanup my work from the previous days a bit before i start and see if this helps to refresh my memory.
