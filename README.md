This is my attempt to keep a journal of my experience with bug bounty. I want to approach this entire experience coming from a sysadmin and developer background with a lot of vulnerability research on the sides.

I am going to attempt to document my experience, thoughts before and after in the hopes that this may help others.

The reasons I am doing this are:
* Get a better understanding of the bugbounty process and get first hand experience with it
* Get better ideas for making targets for our echoCTF platform
* Learn a few of the tools i never wanted to learn, on the go and on the need, ie force my self to understand what gap each of the tool is trying to fill
* Create a Gitlab and Github pipeline that would allow bugbounty hunters and pen-testers to automate some tasks
* (maybe) Get lucky and score a payout in the process ðŸ˜Š

My trip to the bugbounty world starts at midnight of 25/11/2022. Unfortunately i cannot work on it during the day, so my attempts will have to be more directed and with purpose if i plan on doing anything significant.

**WARNING:**

1. I have absolutely no idea what i am doing.
2. I am making fun of my self a lot
3. I dont know what i am doing (did i say that already?)
4. I am trying to figure this up as i go...

_I may occasionally update a previous days entry to include new details. This will mostly include spell checking and inclusion of details that i believe will be useful but didnt have the foresight to include them in the first place._

## Daily Log
* [day 1 - nothing ever goes as planned and that is a good thing](docs/day1.md)
* [day 2 - this new plan will work for sure](docs/day2.md)
* [day 3 - lets use some tooling](docs/day3.md)
* [day 4 - lets use some more tooling](docs/day4.md)

## Notes
Here i will keep my notes about specific tools that i use on my daily attempts. I am trying to document **ONLY** what i use and not create an encyclopedia.

* [Useful DNS Commands](notes/dns.md)
* [Useful `/.well-known/` locations](notes/well-known.md)
* [CDN specifics](notes/cdn.md)
* [Gitlab specifics](notes/gitlab.md)


## Automation

### Gitlab Pipelines
The following pipelines were amassed during my tests and although only the `dns_enum.yml` pipeline has been used on an actual program, the others have been used only under controlled environments.

_NOTE: These are not optimized in any way, shape or form_

I will not be listing them here individually any more because by now they have already way too many. Feel free to go to the following url if you want to use them https://github.com/proditis/BugBounty-Journal/blob/main/_pipelines/
